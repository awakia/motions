# RestKit Sample (Combination of RubyMotion & RubyOnRails)

This sample program is based on the blog (http://thunderboltlabs.com/posts/restkit-object-mapping-with-rubymotion.html)

But the api changed so I need to consult latest api document (At this time version is 0.20)
API References http://restkit.org/api/latest/
